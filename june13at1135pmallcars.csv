He was quite pleasant and explained the car had already been sold the day before. The reason 
the ad was still posted was because their IT person was ill and wasn't able to take it down.

They suggested financing, where I would get free snow tires, and could pay off the truck in six months.  
They forgot to tell me about the financing fee of $700.00.  That along with the $800.00 interest I would have paid for the financing for six 
months adds up to more than the tires were worth.

CarGurus UserJan. 29, 2021Answered my questions in a timely mannerCarGurus UserJan. 29, 2021Was going to pay cash for a truck.  They suggested financing, where I would get free snow tires, and could pay off the truck in six months.  
They forgot to tell me about the financing fee of $700.00.  That along with the $800.00 interest I would have paid for the financing for six 
months adds up to more than the tires were worth.
