months adds up to more than the tires were worth.

CarGurus UserJan. 29, 2021Answered my questions in a timely mannerCarGurus UserJan. 29, 2021Was going to pay cash for a truck.  They suggested financing, where I would get free snow tires, and could pay off the truck in six months.  
They forgot to tell me about the financing fee of $700.00.  That along with the $800.00 interest I would have paid for the financing for six 
months adds up to more than the tires were worth.

The salesperson Bradie was amazing and very efficient. Since I’m out of town he sent me all the photos and car spec information I asked for to view.

They suggested financing, where I would get free snow tires, and could pay off the truck in six months.  
They forgot to tell me about the financing fee of $700.00.  That along with the $800.00 interest I would have paid for the financing for six 
months adds up to more than the tires were worth.

CarGurus UserJan. 29, 2021Answered my questions in a timely mannerCarGurus UserJan. 29, 2021Was going to pay cash for a truck.  They suggested financing, where I would get free snow tires, and could pay off the truck in six months.  
They forgot to tell me about the financing fee of $700.00.  That along with the $800.00 interest I would have paid for the financing for six 
months adds up to more than the tires were worth.

They suggested financing, where I would get free snow tires, and could pay off the truck in six months.  
They forgot to tell me about the financing fee of $700.00.  That along with the $800.00 interest I would have paid for the financing for six 
months adds up to more than the tires were worth.

CarGurus UserJan. 29, 2021Answered my questions in a timely mannerCarGurus UserJan. 29, 2021Was going to pay cash for a truck.  They suggested financing, where I would get free snow tires, and could pay off the truck in six months.  
They forgot to tell me about the financing fee of $700.00.  That along with the $800.00 interest I would have paid for the financing for six 
months adds up to more than the tires were worth.  Left a very bad taste in my mouth.Read 59 more dealer reviews...Kingston, ON (3 km)(343) 307-0450Request Information",https://www.cargurus.ca/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?zip=K7M%203E9&showNegotiable=true&sortDir=ASC&sourceContext=carGurusHomePageModel&distance=50&sortType=PRICE#listing=296624979,CT21-133,"93,907 kilometres","$11,798 ",Car One,"2016 Nissan Juke SV AWD - $11,798",null,JN8AF5MV2GT652217,Car One

They suggested financing, where I would get free snow tires, and could pay off the truck in six months.  
They forgot to tell me about the financing fee of $700.00.  That along with the $800.00 interest I would have paid for the financing for six 
months adds up to more than the tires were worth.
